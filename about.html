            <h4>From Olu "Cario"</h4>
            So... What kind of world do you live in? It lOoks like the normal human world but you are not a human... And these creatures look very real.. Reminds me of Mother 3.
            By the way, extra question: Why do you study in a school that seems to be taken over by humans? Wouldn't it be better to enter one with beings like you? 
            <br><br>
            <div style="font-family: 'Schoolbell', serif; font-size: 2vw; color: blue;"> Uhh, in a normal one? What are humans? I study in a normal school with ''beings'' like me already...</div>

            <h4>From Evelyn "Bluee"</h4>
            Yo, Bluee here! I felt like I should ask a few questions, if you don't bother.<br>
            <br>
            So, first of all, how the hell did you find out that Christian was in love with you in the same day as you talked with him? I wanted to have the same perception skills, because that's insane!.. Did you check their phone?<br>
            Secondly... Who was the god you saw?<br>
            What did you find below Christian's bed?<br>
            Who are "the foXes"?
            Tell me everything.
            <br>
            Also, what's your favorite food? :D<br>
            <br>
            See ya!'
            <br><br>
            <div style="font-family: 'Schoolbell', serif; font-size: 2vw; color: blue;">

                My favorite food is innocent children's souls- Just kidding, I really like strogonoff pizza!
